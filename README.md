Hi, this is my personal webpage. It is full of info about myself as well as sites
that are useful to me. There is stuff related to music making, programming, my car,
personal graphic design projects, my shoe sizes... In general, stuff that I find
useful to have handy.

This webpage is made following my own website guidelines, which could be
summarized as:
* Very simple, readable design.
* Responsive from the beginning.
* Keep distractions to a minimum - almost no animations, no fancy stuff. This
  is a document, not a YouTube video.
* Minimalistic footprint. Minimal JS (only fun stuff), no externally loaded fonts,
  no frameworks or libraries. Again, this is a document, I don't need a full web app
  for a portfolio page.
* As small as possible. Loads lightning fast (really), uses up minimal bandwidth.
