My personal webpage. Divided into my 3 main areas of work: Music making,
coding/programming, and small, personal graphic design projects.

This webpage is made following my own website guidelines, which could be
summarized as:
* Very simple, readable design.
* Responsive from the beginning.
* Keep distractions to a minimum - almost no animations, no fancy stuff. This
  is a document, not a YouTube video.
* Minimalistic footprint. No JS, no externally loaded fonts, no frameworks or
  libraries. Again, this is a document, I don't need a full web app for a
  portfolio page.
* As small as possible. Loads lightning fast (really), uses up minimal
  bandwidth.
