                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Currently working on an DevOps Internship at Ericsson, and finishing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science
                (Computer Engineering branch) in Carlos III university of Madrid. I like programming, teaching CS stuff, cars,
                losing countless hours tweaking a sound in one of my tracks, and music technology.</p>

                <p>When working on a team, I can coordinate with my teammates but I prefer working alone, either in a part of the project
                I can do by myself or in the whole thing. I like documenting my progress, what is done and what is not done, and setting
                realistic baselines to work from there. I have a special interest in lightweight, simple solutions. I don't find joy in using
                the latest technologies but if they are simpler and do the same thing than other tools, I will sure be happy to welcome them.</p>

                <h3>What I know</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p class="cv-whatiknow">How to program. Mostly C-style coding and Python scripting, but also OOP in Java, basic web development, REST APIs, the usual.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="cv-whatiknow">Computer Science and Engineering things, what I learned in the bachelor. I'm also interested in Linux, data storage, (basic) DSP among other things</p></li>
                    <li><p class="cv-whatiknow">Sound and audio, making music in the computer. Creating and finishing electronic music, mixing recordings, DJing,
                        MIDI controllerism, audiovisual generation and performances.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="cv-whatiknow">Basic video recording, editing, production. Vegas and Adobe Premiere, how to process audio so that it sounds great
