                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Currently working on an DevOps Internship at Ericsson, and finishing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science
                (Computer Engineering branch) in Carlos III university of Madrid. I like programming, teaching CS stuff, cars,
                losing countless hours tweaking a sound in one of my tracks, and music technology.</p>

                <p>When working on a team, I can coordinate with my teammates but I prefer working alone, either in a part of the project
                I can do by myself or in the whole thing. I like documenting my progress, what is done and what is not done, and setting
                realistic baselines to work from there. I have a special interest in lightweight, simple solutions. I don't find joy in using
                the latest technologies but if they are simpler and do the same thing than other tools, I will sure be happy to welcome them.</p>
