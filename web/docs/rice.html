                <p><i>Original by <a href=https://teddit.net/r/Cooking/comments/2b5c10/how_do_i_cook_rice/cj22zi9/#c>mornsbarstool</a>, I only copied it here and fixed some punctuation.</i></p>

                <p>EDIT - I thought that this was the 'cooking' subreddit - as in, let's talk about cooking method and technique. The fact that the number one comment is 'use a rice cooker', and that this guide which I spent 20 minutes writing has been repeatedly downvoted leads me to feel that this subreddit is not worth my time. If the community can't at least treat genuine advice with some degree of respect then I have no interest in wasting my time further. I may not be the greatest chef in the world, but I have a good few years of commercial cooking experience under my belt and I mistakenly thought that my contribution would be of some value to you all, but if you'd rather leave the technicalities of cooking to machines then why bother cook at all? Why not accept your inevitable slide towards total dependance on automated food, and simply frequent the ready-made aisle of the supermarket? Why know how to cook a pasta sauce when you can simply microwave one? Better yet, live out of the drive-through! Yes, I know this may come across as the butthurt whinings of someone whose post didn't get enough upvotes, but I am honestly just disappointed in the spirit of the community. But fuck it, you can cook rice any way you want. I'll leave the step-by-step instructions here for those that do want to know about cooking.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Don't buy the cheapest rice. It is amazing what a difference a budget and respectable rice have between them. No, I don't know what they do differently; it looks the same when it goes in, but the end result is like a different thing entirely. Buy some real fancy rice the first time you try this method, just to treat yourself. Shit, even expensive rice is still cheap as far as ingredients go - why screw yourself on the world's cheapest staple?</li>

                    <li>Wash the rice before cooking. Do this every time. You want to get rid of the excess starch that is going to gum up your rice. This is less of an issue with more expensive rice, but do it regardless. Method 1 - put rice in a pan, hit it with a blast of water for a few seconds, wait for the rice to settle, and pour out the water. Repeat this until the water pours off clear. Method 2 - put rice in sieve, spray the shit out of it while shaking the rice around for a good 10-15 seconds. Doesn't much matter which method you use, sieve is probably easier though.</li>

                    <li>Rice, in pan, drained. Now add the cooking water. To be honest, I wish I had an exact formula for this, but I do it by eye. What I can tell you is that I add <b>cold</b> water to twice the depth of rice in the pan. So, shake rice around the level it out, then poke your finger into the rice until it hits metal. Remove finger. See how deep that hole is? Double that. And let me say it again: that water should be <b>cold</b>.</li>

                    <li>Put pan on stove and fire it up. Max heat. You want to bring that water to the boil. As soon as you see bubbles moving through the rice, quickly but gently stir it around to shift any grains that may have just started to stick to the bottom of the pan. A silicone spatula is best for this, and if you don't have a silicone spatula then you need to unfuck yourself by buying one right now.</li>

                    <li>Drop the heat to minimum and add a tightly fitting lid. Sometimes I use a large ring for the boil then move to the small for the simmer, or sometimes I do it all on the small ring. Either way, do the simmer on the smallest ring.</li>

                    <li>Simmer for 12 minutes. <b>Do not remove the lid at any point</b> - I am deadly serious. The rice is going to sit in that pan with some sweet-ass hot water all over it, and those grains are soaking that shit up like a teenager with a Bacardi Breezer. When the level of the water drops below the height of the rice it is the steam which is trapped in the pan which is going to continue to hydrate and cook the rice. That is what is going to give you that ideal dry / moist balance. So, let me re-iterate - <b>Do not remove the lid at any point</b>.</li>

                    <li>After 12 minutes, turn off the heat completely, and move the pan onto a cold ring or trivet if you're using electric. Leave that lid alone. I don't care if you want to look at the rice, because if you take that lid off all you're going to be looking at is the rice you just fucked up. Leave that lid alone. Trust in me.</li>

                    <li>After 10 minutes of resting time you may now remove the lid and use your silicone spatula to gently stir the rice around for 10 seconds or so. This ensures that any residual water coats the grains evenly and the excess steams off.</li>

                    <li>Let the rice sit with the lid off for 3 minutes so the last of the excess can steam off. If you are cooking sushi rice then this is the point where you would stir in your aromatic mix of rice vinegar, salt and sugar, and then spread out the rice on a large tray to really dry out.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By this point you should be staring down the barrel of perfectly cooked pan of rice. It may take a couple of attempts to get the water exactly dialled in, but in my experience this method is pretty forgiving. I always do the water by eye and it comes out perfectly every time.</p>
