                <h2>Electronic music</h2>
                <p>(soon)</p>


                <h2>Keyboard playing</h2>
                <p>I have a pretty long story with "Maestro Gombau" public music school in Getafe. I studied music and
                    keyboard playing for 9 years, playing in bands for 6 of those (at least 4 in
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sde_band/?hl=en">Salida de Emergencia</a>). I took a 4 year break to
                    get more into electronic music making, and I came back as a keyboardist to the music school in September
                    2019.</p>

                <p>Right now I'm playing the keyboards (mainly pianos and EPs, but also some organs and synth pads here
                    and there) in a pop/country/funk band.</p>


                <h2>Other music projects</h2>
                <p>I have been learning and working about Hip Hop and Trap beats production with my partner in musical crime
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1I5xUQoa6yNbUIJoIeYJOQ">Omar Alsayad</a>, with the objective of
                    being able to work (semi)professionally on them. It's a really interesting topic because right now it's
                    a thriving scene and also the older classic tracks from the genre have a groovy style I like to (try to)
                    include in my productions.</p>

                <p>Other stuff I have worked on is videogame music. I collaborated with a small, independent game studio
                    called <a href="https://www.triunitystudios.com/">Triunity Studios</a> working in the music and sound
                    effects of two Android games:
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TriunityStudios.Rasta_Run&hl=en_US">Rasta Run</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TriunityStudios.TS09&hl=en_US">Ball Evolution</a>.
                    You can find a demo of the soundtrack for the second game
                    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/7th-pyramid/demo-ost/s-U4Z6z">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Finally, I attended the <a href="https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/">Utrecht Summer School</a> course on Film
                    Music for Beginners, where we learned how to get started in film music arrangements. During the practical
                    hours we worked on the music in some scenes, and these are mine (don't mind the YouTube audio quality, it's
                    awful):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6qoZaRNIvA">Scene 1</a>: This is the kind of thing I know how to do:
                    sad/tense ambiences with electronic sequences and strings. This one is pretty convincing and overall I think
                    I got a nice result.</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3EZAo7wPTQ">Scene 2</a>: With this other one I wanted to unleash some
                    breakbeat force and decided to go for a dance/film hybrid sound. It really does not fit perfectly, especially
                    in some parts like the climax (just too much drums) but the average quality is decent.</p></li>
                </ul>


                <h2>Music as 7th Pyramid</h2>
                
                <p>This is my first alias and my main one right now. I focus on the faster side of dance music, especially
                    on Drum & Bass with Jungle details, some Halftime, and a lot of atmospheric and melodic parts. Basically
                    I don't usually go hardcore on my tracks, my background in pop/soul/funk music always gets me into the
                    Liquid part of the genre.</p>
                <p>
                    Before focusing on those, I also made some House/Techno-ish stuff at 12X bpm, some dubstep beat stuff and
                    other kinds of things, even
                    <a href="http://www.hhgroups.com/albumes/alex-gato-negro/deja-que-me-exprese-48905/#t06">Hip Hop</a>.</p>

                <h2>Music as Mark II</h2>
                
                <p>While the idea of creating a new alternative alias and separating all the genres I work with
                    in two groups started around 2018, I released the first track under the name "Mark II" on
                    June 2019. I'm using use this alias for my DJing stuff (I sometimes mix Disco House and other kinds
                    of groovy House) as well as for my House productions (and probably some Garagish things in
                    the future).</p>

                <p>You can find all "Mark II" releases again at BandCamp:
