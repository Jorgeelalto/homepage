                <h2>Keyboard playing</h2>
                <p>I have a pretty long story with "Maestro Gombau" public music school in Getafe. I studied music and
                    keyboard playing for 9 years, playing in bands for 6 of those (at least 4 in
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sde_band/?hl=en">Salida de Emergencia</a>). I took a 4 year break to
                    get more into electronic music making, and I came back as a keyboardist to the music school in September
                    2019.</p>

                <p>Right now I'm playing the keyboards (mainly pianos and EPs, but also some organs and synth pads here
                    and there) in a pop/country/funk band.</p>


                <h2>Electronic music</h2>
                <p>I've been into electronic music not that long. I was mainly into different kinds of Metal thanks to my
                    father, and around 2013 I first listened to a Brostep track. The uniqueness and totally different focus
                    of the sound really intrigued me, and it also shared the same raw power of the music I liked. From there
                    I discovered the commercial side of Drum & Bass (mind you, apart from the beat pattern and tempo, they
                    are pretty much the same), and years after I fell into the more underground scenes. I didn't get the thing
                    with House music until 2015 or so with the rise of Future House (and I discovered it thanks to my brother).
                </p>

                <p>I make electronic music and I've been doing it since 2014. You can find more details about that
                    <a href="#edm">below</a>. I work with <a href="http://reaper.fm">Reaper</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.renoise.com/">Renoise</a>, and an assortment of plugins. Reaper allows me to quickly
                    work with and edit audio recordings, as well as MIDI clips. It's my "main" DAW, and the best things about
                    it are the performance and flexibility of the program itself - the programming standards of the developer
                    seem to align really well with what I think it's the "ideal", even the licensing system (affordable price
                    and no online requirements, only a license file). Renoise is also a really good piece of software (best in
                    mangling samples and creating rhythms), and both are rock solid and light on resources (and work on Linux!),
                    as well as full of functionality and technical detail.</p>
                
                <p>As for plugins, I love <a href="https://sugar-bytes.de/">Sugar Bytes</a> synths. They have an amazing
                    user experience and interface, and are a perfect mix of regular synthesizer components (filters and
                    oscillators) and innovative features (weird modulation sources and sequencing). They are not too weird,
                    so you can actually create interesting and usable sounds from them.
                    <a href="https://www.spcplugins.com/arcsyn">ArcSyn</a> also gets a lot of use, when I need to go back to
                    a "regular" synth architecture. In terms of effects, I have a mixed folder of commercial, paid (nice)
                    plugins (Klanghelm and HoRNet) and free plugins. I prefer to use the native ones when possible, though
                    (especially on Renoise where projects are self contained ZIPs and I can easily move them between machines
                    without worrying on plugin and sample availability).</p>

                <h2>My workspace</h2>
                <img src="#">
                <p>This is the equipment I have at home, and this is where I make most of my stuff. I use a PC with Reaper as
                    my main DAW, with Renoise as the secondary (actually I'm making most of my electronic music with Renoise
                    lately). As for plugins I have some Sugar Bytes synths, ArcSyn and a few cheap and free effects (Klanghelm,
                    Tokyo Dawn Labs, several giveaways and promotions...). I also have a big load of samples to use and mangle.</p>
                    
                <p>All my music is made "in the box" and I try to keep the usage of plugins to the minimum, at least in
                    Renoise. Also almost all the audio software I use is online DRM free (with serial number or license file
                    based authorization systems) and as portable as possible (they are either a .dll or .vst3 you can just
                    drop on a fresh install, or the installer does not need internet connection). I feel this is very
                    important when making music on Windows - if you can avoid connecting your computer to the internet you
                    will avoid several background processes messing with the performance and the OS.</p>

                <h2>Other music projects</h2>
                <p>I have been learning and working about Hip Hop and Trap beats production with my partner in musical crime
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1I5xUQoa6yNbUIJoIeYJOQ">Omar Alsayad</a>, with the objective of
                    being able to work (semi)professionally on them. It's a really interesting topic because right now it's
                    a thriving scene and also the older classic tracks from the genre have a groovy style I like to (try to)
                    include in my productions.</p>

                <p>Other stuff I have worked on is videogame music. I collaborated with a small, independent game studio
                    called <a href="https://www.triunitystudios.com/">Triunity Studios</a> working in the music and sound
                    effects of two Android games:
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TriunityStudios.Rasta_Run&hl=en_US">Rasta Run</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TriunityStudios.TS09&hl=en_US">Ball Evolution</a>.
                    You can find a demo of the soundtrack for the second game
                    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/7th-pyramid/demo-ost/s-U4Z6z">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Finally, I attended the <a href="https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/">Utrecht Summer School</a> course on Film
                    Music for Beginners, where we learned how to get started in film music arrangements. During the practical
                    hours we worked on the music in some scenes, and these are mine (don't mind the YouTube audio quality, it's
                    awful):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6qoZaRNIvA">Scene 1</a>: This is the kind of thing I know how to do:
                    sad/tense ambiences with electronic sequences and strings. This one is pretty convincing and overall I think
                    I got a nice result.</p></li>
                    <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3EZAo7wPTQ">Scene 2</a>: With this other one I wanted to unleash some
                    breakbeat force and decided to go for a dance/film hybrid sound. It really does not fit perfectly, especially
                    in some parts like the climax (just too much drums) but the average quality is decent.</p></li>
                </ul>


                <h2 id="edm">Music as 7th Pyramid</h2>
                
                <p>This is my first alias and my main one right now. I focus on the faster side of dance music, especially
                    on Drum & Bass with Jungle details, some Halftime, and a lot of atmospheric and melodic parts. Basically
                    I don't usually go hardcore on my tracks, my background in pop/soul/funk music always gets me into the
                    Liquid part of the genre.</p>
                <p>
                    Before focusing on those, I also made some House/Techno-ish stuff at 12X bpm, some dubstep beat stuff and
                    other kinds of things, even
                    <a href="http://www.hhgroups.com/albumes/alex-gato-negro/deja-que-me-exprese-48905/#t06">Hip Hop</a>.</p>

                <h2>Music as Mark II</h2>
                
                <p>While the idea of creating a new alternative alias and separating all the genres I work with
                    in two groups started around 2018, I released the first track under the name "Mark II" on
                    June 2019. I'm using use this alias for my DJing stuff (I sometimes mix Disco House and other kinds
                    of groovy House) as well as for my House productions (and probably some Garagish things in
                    the future).</p>

                <p>You can find all "Mark II" releases again at BandCamp:
